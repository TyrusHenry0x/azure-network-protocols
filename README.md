# Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines

In this lab, I explored how to observe and manipulate network traffic between Azure Virtual Machines using Wireshark and Network Security Groups (NSGs). I used real-world tools to analyze network protocols and configure security rules.

## Environments and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Command-Line Tools
- Network Protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

## Operating Systems Used

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Linux Ubuntu Server 20.04
